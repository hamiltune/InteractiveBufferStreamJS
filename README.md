# InteractiveBufferStreamJS
Ever wanted an audio interfact to enqueue buffers in almost real time? Look no further! The Hamiltune JavaScript Context will allow you to Enqueue audio buffers and have them played back in (almost) real time! Great for projects where you may need to enqueue data quickly like streaming. All you have to do is call the "Enqueue" method on your HJSContext object. The intention of this project is to provide a more interactive audio interface for WebGL applications (specifically Unity).
